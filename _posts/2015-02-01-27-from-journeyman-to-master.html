<p>I finished reading The Pragmatic Programmer by the end of January (from 13th to 31st, actually).</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of it is outdated, some are already norms taken for granted, some of it is wisdom.<br />
- From my twitter</p></blockquote>
<p>The book mentions some practices, tools, frameworks, etc that aren't applicable anymore but if you focus on the thought instead of the outdated and the dead, there's really some good thoughts on this book.</p>
<p>My main takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything in the "Geeky Goals" (as my friends call it) section, especially "<strong>Read one book every quarter</strong>" and "<strong>Learn one language every year</strong>"</li>
<li><strong>Testing is a must</strong>. No matter how much programmers hate to do it.</li>
<li><strong>Document</strong> your assumptions, estimates, and (something else I forget) but basically <strong>document </strong>so that you can see how close your estimates were or how right your assumptions. Documenting also allows you to see your progress.</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong>. If there are repetitive tasks, just find ways to automate them. (I'll try starting on Monday with AutoHotkey. Great place to start is I always run i.e. as admin, and some folders I always open like the shared team folder.)</li>
<li><strong>Go Meta</strong>. This is one of the things I think are taken for granted, especially in Android. I think it's good to learn from this practice and build upon it.</li>
<li><strong>Program consciously</strong>. The opposite of Programming By Coincidence, this basically means that you must not stop at the point where the code works. You have to understand why. (Flashback to those times I messed around with FragmentTransactions and their inconsistent behavior. Ugh!)</li>
</ol>
<p>So that's it. Maybe I'll add more if anything comes to mind. I just wanted to put my thoughts down, so that I can come back later and see how off the mark I am. Documentation, see? LOL</p>
<p><em>Next books on my list: Headfirst Design Patterns, Effective Java, Clean Code, Effective Unit Testing, and some data structures and algorithms book.</em></p>
