<p><em>Warning: This isn't the usual informative post. This is more of a narrative of how I got (or didn't get) started with TDD.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>By 2022 it will be not be possible to get a professional programming job if you do not practice TDD routinely.</p>
<p>-Allan Kelly</p></blockquote>
<p>It's the year 2014, and I had just turned 26 when I read this. It's 8 years until deadline, but I'll be old by then. "I have to start learning this", I told myself. And I had to do it quick.</p>
<p>The quickest way to learn it was have someone teach me. Luckily, <a href="http://noobgrammer.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/down-the-test-driven-rabbit-hole/">Rocky was willing. </a>We set up a small group who were interested in the topic and in the span of an hour, Rocky discussed TDD and Unit Testing (at that time I thought they were one and the same), Robotium, Robolectric, integration tests, instrumentation tests, kata, and a whole lot of gibberish. I was the only one who was genuinely interested, so I pretended to understand. I asked a lot of questions that got answers that I couldn't digest. And it didn't help that Rocky was unprepared. (Don't get me wrong, I consider Rocky the most brilliant in our company but brilliance is different from preparedness.)</p>
<p>In the end, it was all too much for me and I didn't even do the assignment he gave us. (It was a simple Android project, but you had to do it the TDD way.) I admit, I'm a lazy cowboy.</p>
<p>The week after, we talked about his sudden resignation. He encouraged me to keep at TDD even if I had no interest in finishing the assignment. "You should start with the kata", he said.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, kata!", I replied. I didn't have a fucking clue what he meant.</p>
<p><em>TO BE CONTINUED</em></p>
