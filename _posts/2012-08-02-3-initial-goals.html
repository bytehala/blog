<p>Currently I already have a logo which looks sweet, and I copy-pasted AndEngine code for the AnalogOnScreenControl which will be used to control the player fish, which according to the file names is a salmon![gallery columns="2"]</p>
<p>I'm breaking down tasks into the easiest and has most impact UI-wise first (like rapid prototyping and all that). So current tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background image</li>
<li>Bounding box - because the fish can swim to infinity</li>
<li>Texts - score, lives left, "Avoid" text</li>
<li>Simple collision models - just diamonds, not mouth-body models</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope I can make all of that in one day. Go away distractions! :P</p>
