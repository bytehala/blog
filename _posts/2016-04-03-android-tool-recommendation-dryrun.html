<p>If you're like me, you like testing out libraries on Android. If you're like me, you're lazy and would rather not create a whole sample app from scratch to test out the said library.</p>
<p>Luckily for us lazy people, most libraries that get released on Github have sample apps.</p>
<p>So you usually import the sample app onto your Android Studio, launch an emulator / attach your phone, and then run the app. Then you decide if you want to use the library or not, and most probably forget about the clutter you wrought upon yourself by downloading so many sample applications.</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider this: you just type one line on your shell, the app runs on your emulator or phone, and the clutter is cleaned by itself. Sound good?</p></blockquote>
<p>That's what <a href="https://github.com/cesarferreira/dryrun" target="_blank">Cesar Ferreira's Dryrun</a> does.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be an Android dev, so that you already have the Android tooling on your system.</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>ANDROID_HOME environment variable set to your sdk location.</li>
<li>A running emulator / a connected device</li>
<li>Patience (if you don't have patience, a fast internet connection can be used as substitute)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre>gem install dryrun</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<pre class="p1"><span class="s1">dryrun https://github.com/cesarferreira/android-helloworld</span></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The tool will download the gradle wrapper and the app's dependencies for you, then run it on your device.</p>

<h3><strong>More Recommendations</strong> (aka Let Me Shove This Down Your Throat Since You're Already Here)</h3>
<p>I heard about this from reading this listicle:</p>
<p id="dd11" class="graf--h3 graf-after--figure"><a href="https://medium.com/@cesarmcferreira/building-android-apps-30-things-that-experience-made-me-learn-the-hard-way-313680430bf9#.50intab0o">Building Android Apps — 30 things that experience made me learn the hard way</a></p>
<p>which I saw from the Medium daily digest, because it was liked by Chris Lacy (whom you should know if you're serious about Android).</p>
<p>Cesar has other articles that you'll enjoy, such as speeding up Gradle builds, Gradle hacks simplified, etc. He's also got some fun libraries on his Github like CatKit, which puts cat images as placeholders on your ImageViews.</p>
<p>Basically follow Chris and Cesar on Medium, Github, Google+ (is that still a thing?), Twitter... everywhere!</p>
