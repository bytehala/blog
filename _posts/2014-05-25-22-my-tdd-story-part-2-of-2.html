<p><em>WARNING: This post does not aim to inform in any way. However, I'd be happy if this inspires anyone (including me). This is part 2 of my narrative, if you care to read the first part, <a href="http://noobgrammer.wordpress.com/2014/05/18/21-my-tdd-story-part-1-of-2/">here it is.</a></em></p>
<blockquote><p>Before you can run, you must learn how to walk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I already told the story of how boring a task trying to learn TDD was for me. I mean this: WRITE THE TESTS FIRST BEFORE WRITING SOME CODE. Pfft! Come on, how ludicrous is that? I couldn't be bothered to do something so unnecessary.</p>
<p>Well, that's my excuse for not learning something that's actually useful because it's so hard.</p>
<p>Still, I hadn't given up on my Test Driven dreams. Or rather, it <a href="http://noobgrammer.wordpress.com/2014/04/05/down-the-test-driven-rabbit-hole/">caught up with me.</a></p>
<p>So I strengthened my resolve: I was going to write tests no matter what.</p>
<p>I open Eclipse... *blink blink*... nothing! I don't know how to write a test. I don't even know how to use JUnit. I use my favorite ability: Google. <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/11wi/eclipse-tutorial/junit.shtml">Now I know how to do it</a>. I start writing a test for... nothing. Now that is a really hard barrier. How can you test nothing? Later that day, in my search for "unit test exercises" I learn about kata from Peter Provost's blog. <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd">It's the only way to learn TDD, he claims.</a> (I agree with him, btw.) He says you have to do kata for 30 minutes every day for the rest of your career, or 21 days at first. I also find out about Roy Osherove's unit testing book, and some mentions about a TDD lecture he did at NDC 2009. I promise to start doing kata the very same day. <a href="http://noobgrammer.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/20-tddbits-understanding-tdd-by-roy-osherove/">I did it 4 days later</a>, the day after I watched Roy Osherove's lecture.</p>
<p>And I never looked back.</p>
