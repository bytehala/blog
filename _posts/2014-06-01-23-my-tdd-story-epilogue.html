<p><em>... and I never looked back.</em></p>
<p>Update (24 January 2015): I have stopped doing Katas. I still don't practice TDD, and right now I want to learn A LOT of stuff simultaneously (UX Design, Functional Programming, The Pragmatic Programmer, etc.) If I had all the time in the world, I'd read and read... and play Bomb Squad.</p>
