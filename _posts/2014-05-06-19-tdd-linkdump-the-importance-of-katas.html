<p>This morning I gave myself an ultimatum: TDD my personal project now or never at all. (Exaggeration, but yeah.)</p>
<p>So I scrambled to learn TDD, learn it first before I can move on with the project.</p>
<p>I found some books that I would like to read:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Art of Unit Testing - <a href="http://osherove.com" target="_blank">Roy Osherove</a></li>
<li>Some book about Agile - Uncle Bob</li>
</ul>
<p>That's on top of the books I'm currently reading</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Feeling Lucky - Googler #59</li>
<li>Clean Code - Uncle Bob</li>
<li>Holub on Patterns - Holub</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course along with MAJOR Java topics I'm weak on: Concurrency, Networking, Reflection. Plus Android's Handlers.</p>
<p>That's a lot, it's overwhelming, it's a lifetime commitment but I digress.</p>
<p>Apparently, in the programming world, there exist kata. Kata in martial arts means form. It's something you go through at the start of every practice session to commit those forms to muscle memory. Peter Provost claims that <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd" target="_blank">the only way to learn TDD is through kata.</a> The advise is to pick one kata, do it for 30 minutes every day for two weeks until you get comfortable with how TDD flows.</p>
<p>Don't even start doing TDD on real projects before you're comfortable with TDD. I guess my ultimatum won't be ultimate after all, but I'm glad it lead me to this.</p>
<p>I will start doing it. Starting today (1st of May 2014).</p>
<p>But I'll have to shave a little yak first, I don't even know JUnit. That is all.</p>
