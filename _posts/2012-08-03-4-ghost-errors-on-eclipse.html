<p>Sometimes on Eclipse, you would encounter errors that are just so frustrating that you almost pull your hair out. Then you check, double-check, and triple-check your code and your syntax and you see absolutely nothing wrong with it. Looks like this:</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_28" align="aligncenter" width="374"]<a href="http://noobgrammer.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ghost.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-28" title="ghost" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ghost.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="154" /></a> Second most common cause of hair loss in programmers.[/caption]</p>
<p>You know that sometimes Eclipse just screws up sometimes and all you need is a Clean command, and-slash-or a reboot of Eclipse. You do that, and the error's still there. You reboot your machine, the error's still there. Don't pull your hair out just yet.</p>
<p>All you have to do when you're definitely absolutely sure that there are no errors and Eclipse is just being weird is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cut the line in question. Paste it on the same line.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it. That's all it takes. You just have to delete the line so Eclipse resets the so-called "error" that's supposedly there. When you paste the code back in, Eclipse will agree with you that there is indeed no error on that line. Try it!</p>
