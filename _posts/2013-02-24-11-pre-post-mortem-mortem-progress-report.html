<p>I'm making an Atlas builder tool for AndEngine. It's not even necessary, since there's the BuildableAtlas tool that does it automatically for you, but here I am. I'm doing it because the first tip that Game Programming Gems throws at you is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make the tool that makes the data.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Actually, upon checking, it's Idea #7)</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_79" align="aligncenter" width="419"]<a href="http://noobgrammer.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/hale.png"><img class=" wp-image-79 " alt="I called it Hale, because I think it's cool..." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hale.png" width="419" height="358" /></a> I called it Hale, because I think it's cool...[/caption]</p>
<p>It looks something like that. That was the Alpha that I thought I should unleash upon all AndEngine users. Good thing that Qt deployment is a headache, I wasn't able to release it. I was rushing the release to impress a prospective employer. HAH!</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried using it today in building my own game and guess what? I found it really unusable because the Alpha Build did not have a Save/Load Project feature. I had to input the atlas parameters again every time I wanted to use the software. If there's any takeaway from this, it's this:</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>NEVER RELEASE ANYTHING THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD NOT USE!</strong></p>
<p>I just dogfed myself, and it did not taste good!</p>
<p>So here I am, done with the saving part, and almost finished with the loading code. Whew.</p>
<p>Moar post-mortem to follow when I Beta it, with such mistakes/compromises as "I designed it too well!" Yes, I said that for real. To myself, of course!</p>
<p>Bonus: there's going to be a photo of the sketches I made. Yeeeyy! Dreadful.</p>
