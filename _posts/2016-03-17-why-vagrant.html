<p>I'm currently taking the Relational Databases course on Udacity, and performing the exercises requires you to run Vagrant. That was how I was introduced to this eye-opening tool. The next day, while borrowing another book at the library, I came across Mitchell Hashimoto's <em>Vagrant Up and Running  </em>and decided to check it out.</p>
<p>What follows are my notes, my point of view of Vagrant. What I say may have already been stated elsewhere on the web earlier, better, clearer by someone else but this is how I see it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Vagrant?</strong></p>
<p>Vagrant is a tool for quickly creating a virtual environment, with the basics set up so you don't have to.</p>
<p>I remember when I was playing around with Ubuntu on my Windows laptop I had so many headaches trying to figure out why my shared folder wouldn't work (I needed to download a plugin, because it wasn't supported out of the box). After that comes <em>apt-get</em>ting everything you want that's not included as a default app.</p>
<p>With Vagrant, users can download <strong>boxes </strong>(VM templates, basically) and when they <strong>vagrant up</strong>, the VM will already have its shared folders, networking, apps, even ssh login already set up.</p>
<p>If you're convinced, head on to vagrantup.com for the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Vagrant for?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I am a developer and I find immense enjoyment knowing that I can have an entire environment sandboxed just by typing two commands.</p>
<p>However, I can see sysops people using this in their field as well. Being able to package a whole environment, sysops can configure a box the same way as their production server and distribute these to the devs. That way, devs can test on their own machines but with an environment very close to production. Actually, Vagrant environments can even BE the production servers.</p>
<p><strong>Try it out!</strong></p>
<p>The beauty of Vagrant is you are able to package the environments for mass consumption. Just imagine working on your own laptop, but having the same build toolchains as everyone else on your dev team. Every. Time. When tools or software are updated, everyone just checks out the latest environment on their machines and carries on coding.</p>
<p>This is the approach the Udacity people used. The advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>For students, they just need to set Vagrant up. No headache of tracking down installers for Python, PostgreSQL, etc... Everything needed is already prepackaged in the Vagrant box.</li>
<li>For course administrators, faculty, teachers, etc they'll have less emails or forum posts to read which all basically just say "HELP! I CANNOT RUN THE COMMAND EVEN IF I FOLLOWED YOUR INSTRUCTION." These questions usually arise because students are using many different versions of many different software. With Vagrant, instructors KNOW what environment students are using because it's provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on to brushing up on my SQL...</p>
