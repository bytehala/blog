<p>There are three things that Android must know about a resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Its variable name</span></li>
<li>Its ID</li>
<li>Its value</li>
</ul>
<p>The programmer, meanwhile, uses the ID most of the time and achieves this by using the variable name, e.g. R.string.my_string is an integer ID, but my_string is how the user calls it.</p>
<p>The relationship between the three goes this way: the <strong>value</strong> is set by the programmer, but it's hard trying to memorize it, that's why you assign a <strong>variable name</strong> to it, for which Android generates an <strong>ID</strong>.</p>
<p>Now if you had a String <em>knownString</em>, which corresponds to a variable name, how then can you get the value of the resource? Note that in the example above, R.string.my_string is an int value for my_string which is a variable name. None of those is a String.</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<blockquote><p>int varId = context.getResources().getIdentifier("&lt;package_name&gt;:&lt;variable_type&gt;/" + knownString,<br />
"&lt;variable_type&gt;",<br />
context.getPackageName());<br />
if (varId != 0)<br />
{<br />
String value = context.getResources().getString(captionId);<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>package_name - the <strong>package</strong> attribute in your manifest</p>
<p>variable_type - could be string, id, drawable, etc.</p>
<p>If knownString doesn't correspond to any of the declared variables, then varId would be zero, and you get a null value. &lt;package_name&gt;:&lt;variable_type&gt;/ is necessary because sometimes <em>knownString</em> is int-parseable and that causes some problems.</p>
<p>----- Boooooring... THIS POST HAS NO PICTURES!-------</p>
<p><strong>Q: So when would I get to use this knowledge?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>I've mostly used this when there were <em>knownStrings</em> from an XML file returned from a server. Basically, the server returned some abstract form, and it wanted values for some Strings that it knew or hoped were in my resources. It's good because with this method I don't have to use literals from the server, or another method of locale-specific translation, I just use Android's built-in one. :)</p>
