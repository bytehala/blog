<p>Since I updated my LG Optimus Black's ROM to Zeus, I've been hanging around xda-developers lately. I heard about apktool from there, and it's a great tool that allows you to take full control of the apps that you install on your Android phone. Want to change the notification icons on an app? It can be done. Want to add features to an app? It can be done (with a lot of hard hard hard work).</p>
<p>But something being doable is quite different from something being doable easily. After a small amount of <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=695701">random internet clicks</a>, I found myself looking at <a href="http://apkmultitool.com">apkmultitool</a>.</p>
<p>Apkmultitool is a pre-packaged tool that has apktool and a whole host of other apps and utilities that make editing. Its launcher is a command-line script, and from there you just set your target apk, tell it what you want to do, do your thing, and then make the app do things to your bidding. Words words words, what am I even talking about? Let's look at some pictures! (While also learning how to install multitool, of course!)</p>
<p>Oh silly me. Before pictures, we have to do some stuff first, like download the package... After you download the latest zip file from their <a href="http://apkmultitool.com/?q=node/5">download page</a>, unzip it to C:\apkmultitool &lt;- Highly recommended because it doesn't have spaces, and is easy to go to from command line. Launch your command line interface and go to where you unzipped the contents. You have to run setup.bat first.</p>

Pictures!!![/caption]</p>
<p>Pick 3 because you should have downloaded the latest package, so it can't be choice 1. It can't be choice 2 because at the moment I have no idea what it does. I'll make a post when I finally understand. (Am I making myself clear, Self? Okay.)</p>
<p>That's it, basically. Damn, I lied again, I said pictures with an 's'. But thank God that's over, right? :P</p>
<p>(If you're wondering what happened to the FishDish project, there's already lots of prey and they swim, and they get eaten, BUT it's been shelved for now because I had to find myself a real job so that I can continue functioning in a world that runs on money. &lt;- Social commentary? Really?! heh)</p>
