<p>I am currently reading Seven Languages in 7 Weeks, and I just finished the frustratingly hard (but enjoyable) exercises for Day 2. [After trying that, I must say I've given up all hope of actually finishing the whole book in just 7 weeks. No biggie, I like the book regardless.]</p>
<p><strong>The Exercises</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/bytehala/slsw_ruby_day2/blob/master/treetest.rb">Tree</a> class was interesting, but it did not allow you to specify a new tree with a clean user interface. Let the initializer accept a nested structure with hashes and arrays. You should be able to specify a tree like this:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre>{'grandpa' =&gt; {'dad' =&gt; {'brother' =&gt; {}, 'me' =&gt; {}},
              'uncle' =&gt; {'jacob' =&gt; {}, 'edward' =&gt; {}}
              }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Write a simple grep that will print the lines of a file having any occurrences of a phrase anywhere in that line. You will need to do a simple regular expression match and read lines from a file. (This is surprisingly simple in Ruby.) If you want, include line numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Solutions</strong></p>
<p>Can be found on <a href="https://github.com/bytehala/slsw_ruby_day2">my Github repository for these exercises.</a></p>
<p>[WARNING] Might have some lingering debug code. Heh</p>
<p><strong>Difficulties Encountered</strong></p>
<p>No need to read past this point, this is purely for me. Actually, this whole blog is. You might not understand for lack of context.</p>
<p>One major difficulty was that I do not know yet how to debug Ruby. So everything had to be outputted to the console. Ugh.</p>
<p>The hash as an input is simple enough as it is, because if you break down the elements of the hash it always looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h6>[1] element : {x}</h6>
<h6>[2] x : key =&gt; content</h6>
<h6>[3] content : element/{x} or {x1, x2}</h6>
<h6>[4] key : (string literals)</h6>
</blockquote>
<p>(Backus-Naur Form and metasyntax come to mind, but I'm too lazy to explain that or Google the actual way of doing it.) So, the difficulty for me was that I only had 2, the first half of 3, and 4 as my assumptions. Purely my fault, but what I ended up having was outputs that were missing one of the two children for each family, in every permutation possible (i.e. sometimes 'me' was missing, sometimes my 'brother' was, sometimes 'jacob' was, etc) depending on how I banged my head against the code. Something that helped was when 'mebrother' showed up on the console... I was iterating prematurely, or too late. Also, on the line where it says</p>
<pre><span class="pl-smi">@children</span>[k] <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-c1">Tree</span>.<span class="pl-k">new</span>({k =&gt; v})
</pre>
<p>I was just passing <em>v</em> or the <em><strong>content </strong></em>into the recursion, effectively having a keyless and therefore nameless child. Okay, that sounds kind of scary in real life.</p>
<p>For the grep problem, the main pain point was you <strong>really </strong>did need to use regex. I used the license.txt which you can find on the repo, and if you don't use regex and stick to string literals, the code just returns the first line it finds the string on. I was trying to find 'License', and it returned just line 1. Then I replaced it with /License/ on the line[word] part, and behold, it worked. So I basically had to look for ways to convert the user input to a regex and through trial and error, the %r notation worked best.</p>
