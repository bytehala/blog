<p>I released a sample project to GitHub. Kind of hesitated, because about a few months back, I was a bottom-feeder complacent developer, and my GitHub is testament to that. But **** that, right? I realized GitHub is a great way to track your own progress: how you learn, how much you've learned, answers to your own questions in commit messages, yada yada. So what if my other (never-completed-project) repositories are crap? At least it can be a way to compare how far I've improved. HAHA!</p>
<p>Oh... So anyway, the project is here: <a href="https://github.com/bytehala/flow-mortar-gradle-example" target="_blank">bytehala/flow-mortar-gradle-example</a></p>
<p>It's actually the first repo that I'm willing to share, and it feels great.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>This post is not a tutorial on how to use the libraries.</strong> I know that a tutorial is much needed, because Mortar requires some tightly coupled classes for it to work and it's hard for beginners to delve into, but I figured out that I learn by doing. I learned how to use Flow and Mortar by piecing things together, diving into the git history, reading code, but most importantly doing actual coding work.</p>
<hr />
<h6>Flow</h6>
<p>Flow is Square's own library for managing your application's backstack. I've had to wrestle with FragmentManager's backstack for an <a title="#26 – Post Mortem of Freelance Coupons App" href="https://noobgrammer.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/26-post-mortem-of-freelance-coupons-app/" target="_blank">app I did</a> and I think I lost. So I tried Flow out, and I think it's magic!</p>
<h6>Mortar</h6>
<p>I'm not really sure what Mortar is, but from what I understand, it's gives you a simpler lifecycle for your application components. It also simplifies architecting Dagger Modules for you, as well as subgraphs. Mortar also requires for each component to have Presenters in which you'll put business logic, effectively decoupling it from your View code. The Presenters can also be saved into a Bundle. I think.</p>
<h6>Why Did I Do This?</h6>
<p>I did it because I <del>want</del> need to use Flow in a new project.</p>
<p>I did it because I wanted to learn Mortar.</p>
<p>I did it because Mortar's sample project is not Gradle-ready as of this writing. It's actually outdated and references deprecated and/or deleted classes from the Flow sample project.</p>
<p>I did it because I DID IT. I was able to make the sample project!</p>
