<p>I can't believe I'm even doing this. This isn't a blog for game reviews! I barely even game anymore.</p>
<p>Well that just means I enjoyed the game so much that it's worth blogging about.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hackedapp.com/">Hacked</a> is an Android game where you complete missions and solve puzzles using the game's programming language "H". It's pseudo-code with a bit of hmm functional programming thrown into the mix. With that nature, anyone with a bit of programming background and a liking for puzzles can enjoy it.</p>
<p>In Story Mode, you're approached by a random guy who gives you a hackpad (your phone, actually). You start out with a basic set of features and commands like variables and addition. With the limited resources available to you, you're given missions to complete, with nicely progressing difficulty. What I like about this mode is the missions that you complete sometimes become tools for you to use: successfully sort an array and you're granted a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">sort()</span> method, usable on the next mission.</p>
<p>Every problem has 10 test cases, but only shows you 3. There's a percentage indication of how many cases you've solved. If you're missing an edge case, you have to spend "hackoins" to see one random unsolved test case. Don't worry, hackoins are earned after each mission (you also have the option to buy with moolah). You're scored based on how fast you solved the problem, how much you edited your code (!!!), and if I'm not mistaken how optimized your code is.</p>
<p>Something I found equally frustrating and fun about H is that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">while</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">foreach</span> are the only loop structures. And there's no break either. These limitations force you to really think about your loops. There's no shortcut out of it.</p>
<p>One of the challenges I'm still kicking myself for is sorting, because I challenged myself not to use bubble sort. I ended up using it anyway. One thing I learned: insertion sort only appears to use <em>n log n</em> worst-case runtime, but actually it's <em>n-squared</em>.</p>
<p>Also, because I like having pictures on every post, and because I kept trying to solve this the hard way (I forgot that a new function was available, so I actually tried to go imperative) here's the solution for the anagram problem:</p>

Don't click.[/caption]</p>
<p>Oh, btw there's also puzzle mode where you can test your skills on more challenges. This can be done even if you're not finished with the story mode yet. There's also a sort of "app store" where people post stuff they've made in-app, usually games. MAKING GAMES IN A GAME! So meta. Some of the popular ones are clones of flappy bird, snake, game of life, and space invaders. You can make one yourself and choose to post it on there. I'm thinking of making a text-based choose your own adventure but I'm too busy learning new stuff. Ha! But really, it's great that there's already a hacker community built around a specialized programming language made for a game.</p>
<p>There's still lots of improvement, new features and bug fixing going on so some stuff might change like adding a break or do-while (I'd rather they don't do this). I did encounter a bug where the app was becoming unresponsive but that was a one-off (still... Uncle Bob hates "but that was a one-off"). Some feature I'd like to see is writing files to disk so user-made games can save high scores locally.</p>
