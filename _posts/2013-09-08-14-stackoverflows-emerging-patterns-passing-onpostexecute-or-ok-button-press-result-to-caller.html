<p>Just a quickie for some patterns I've observed and will possibly use much in my Android development career/hobby/life.</p>
<p><strong>onPostExecute</strong></p>
<p>If your onPostExecute is an inner class in your Activity, it's this simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
class MyActivity extends Activity {
    
    function runOnPostExecute(Output output) {
        // something...
    }

    class Async extends AsyncTask&lt;Input, Progress, Output&gt; {
        // other stuff...
        onPostExecute(Output output) {
            runOnPostExecute(output);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If the AsyncTask subclass is not inside the Activity, you will have to pass a reference of the Activity into the AsyncTask just so you can call the runOnPostExecute function. Be careful when doing this, as you might leak some references.</p>
<p><strong>on OK clicked</strong></p>
<p>From a DialogFragment's onClick() method, you can also pass some result, or even just the fact that something happened to its parent Activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
class MyDialogFragment extends DialogFragment {
    
    // other stuff...
    
    function onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
        // check which button was clicked and then...
        ((MyActivity) getActivity()).doPositiveClick(Object someResult);
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>doPositiveClick() is a programmer-defined function in MainActivity. As you can see, the DialogFragment doesn't have to be an inner class of your activity. Fragments have a reference to the Activity through getActivity(), so you wouldn't have to worry about leaks as long as you're not leaking this Fragment itself.</p>
