<p><strong>Read it. Seriously.</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to be a geek to know who Elon Musk is. If you've been living under a rock, and don't know who he is, let me tell you by way of the companies he owns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tesla - Sells SEXY cars that run on electricity. And battery packs for your home.</li>
<li>SpaceX - Currently doing resupply missions for the International Space Station. But their ultimate goal is colonising Mars.</li>
<li>Solar City - Solar panels for homes, on the cheap.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Previously, Musk also owned Paypal and Zip2 which is like Google Maps for businesses.)</p>
<p>Just by looking at the 3 companies, you can tell that Musk's mission is the advancement of the human race as space-faring beings.</p>
<p>I'm not going to detail much of what's in the books, but know this: Growing up in South Africa, Musk was always different. A socially awkward nerd who had photographic memory. He later decided that he would need to be in Silicon Valley to make his rocket dreams come true. First, he had to stay in a youth hostel in Canada, study in Queen's College, work for a bank, and a multitude of other things to fulfil his goals. I wouldn't even call them detours, more like pre-requisites.</p>
<p>"Wait," you think. "Zip2? Paypal? What do those things have to do with space?"</p>
<p>Answer: Money. Elon Musk used the money he earned from selling these companies to get to where he is now. You see, he wasn't always a millionaire.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is an inspiration. He had a goal. He focused on that goal. He worked on achieving that goal.</p>
<p>After listening to the book, I started working on my Github again. Learning a new language. Working every day until I become fluent in Scala.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a geek to know who Elon Musk is. You don't have to be a geek to be inspired by him either.</p>
